<h1>WSUL/XSUL User Guide</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>The purpose of this document is to explain concepts behind XSUL and give you
enough to use XSUL in your applications.</p>
<p>XSUL stands for &quot;WS/XML Utility Library&quot;. Instead of creating one all
encompassing architecture XSUL is striving to provide set of tools. Great deal
of effort went to make sure that tools are compatible and easy to plug together. </p>

<p>The glue that binds all tools in XSUL is
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/">XML Infoset</a> based API called
<a href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/xpp/xb1/">XB1 (XML Pull
Builder)</a>. </p>

<p>XSUL tools are called modules and each module provides one simple function or
is an abstraction or a tool used by other modules.</p>

<p>Important part of XSUL design is to enable easy building of Web Services. To
this extent XSUL supports
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/">SOAP 1.1</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/">SOAP 1.2</a> providing set of handy
utility classes to work with SOAP messages irrelevant of SOAP version. </p>

<p>As most of current Web Services are using HTTP therefore XSUL has small and
simple to use HTTP client and server implementations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Zen of XSUL</h2>

<p>Zen of XSUL is XML Infoset. So go and read first XML Information Set </p>

<p align="left">Le me repeat this: <b>read</b>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-infoset-20011024/">XML Infoset spec</a>, to get feeling of it, contemplate on it, and see all
XML in this light :-)</p>

<p>XSUL uses XB1 from XPP3. It is a straightforward translation of XML Infoset
into Java API.</p>

<p>When you know this everything else in XSUL is just set of modules to send or
received XML Infoset as SOAP or XML messages and transform XML Infoset. As part
of transformation to work with other libraries it may be necessary to transform
XML Infoset into DOM API and extensive support for it is provided (for example
in case when using existing XML digital signature libraries that work with DOM
as input and output).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2> Working With XML Messages</h2>

<p> In XSUL there are three different levels on which one can work with XML
messages:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Application Level</b>: <i>XmlElement message</i>
	(invoker/MessageInvoker, processor/MessageProcessor)<br>
	This is actual XML element that has content of XML message that needs to be
	sent or processed.<br>
	On this level there is no need to worry about SOAP header, transport header,
	etc. - just application logic.</li>
	<li><b>XML Messaging/Routing Level</b>: <i>XmlDocument doc</i>
	(invoker/DynamicInfosetInvoker, processor/DynamicInfosetProcessor)<br>
	Whole XML document is received and processed - this level is good to do XML
	level routing (such as with WS-Addressing or ebXML)</li>
	<li><b>Transport Specific/Routing</b>: <i>MessageContext context</i>
	(message_router/MessageProcessingNode, message_router/MessageRouter)<br>
	Message context is a flexible tree structure (thin wrapper around
	XmlElement) that contains incoming message (request), outgoing message
	(response) if any, any other data that may be deemed appropriate (such as
	HTTP/SSL security related).<br>
	MessageContext is passed between processing nodes until one node returns
	true to indicate that processing was finished. If outgoing message was set
	then it is used as a response.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p> Additionally there is RPC layer providing convenient mapping of XML Infoset
to Java Types. Mapped XML message is then used to invoke RPC service.
JDK 1.3 Dynamic Proxies are used to create stubs on the fly that
translate Java types into XML Infoset and send invocation to target Web Service.
See <b>soaprpc*</b> modules for details.</p>
<p> Key modules providing abstractions for XML message processing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>invoker</b>: handle invocation</li>
	<li><b>processor</b>: handle processing of XML messages on XML messaging and
	application level</li>
	<li><b>message_router</b>: powerful routing using both XML message content
	and transport specific information</li>
</ul>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<h2> Working with SOAP 1.1 and 1.2</h2>
<p> In WSUL SOAP comes in two &quot;fragrances&quot;: 1.1 and 1.2.</p>
<p align="left"> See reference card for
<a href="../modules/soap_util/xsul/soap/package.html#select">soap modules</a>.</p>
<h3> Utility functions for processing SOAP in any version</h3>
<p> There are two sets of easy to use utility functions to quickly generate XML
Infoset for SOAP and to extract content of SOAP body.</p>
<p> For more details see reference card for
<a href="../modules/soap_util/xsul/soap/package.html#util">soap modules</a>.</p>
<h2> Working with WS-Addressing</h2>
<p> WSUL provides easy to use WS-Addressing API.</p>
<p> For more details see reference card for
<a href="../modules/ws_addressing/xsul/ws_addressing/package.html">ws_addressing
module</a></p>

<h2> Using HTTP transport directly</h2>

<p> XSUL provides simple and small HTTP client and server side library.</p>

<p> For more details and usage examples please reference cards for
<a href="../modules/http_client/xsul/http_client/package.html">http_client</a>
and <a href="../modules/http_server/xsul/http_server/package.html">http_server</a>
modules.</p>

<h2> Working With XML Messages In Practice</h2>
<p> We will create a simple service, say ... Stock Quote service :-)</p>
<p> Receiving XML</p>
<p> Sending XML</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<h3> SOAP Wrappers</h3>
<p> They provide convenient way to work with SOAP content.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> SoapDocument / SoapEnvelope / SoapHeader / SoapBody / SoapFault</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> SoapFactory is entrypoint to produce </p>
<p> is/setW3cFragrance(true) = use SOAP .2 otherwise SOAP 1.1 is used (which is
currently default unless overridden by WSDL SOAP binding)</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<h2> On MessageContext and weak linking</h2>
<p> MessageContext uses addChild from XmlElement to add reference to XML
messages.</p>
<p> If addElement was used then it would be an error in case if XML message has
a parent.</p>
<p> Using addChild() is weak linking as it does not require child element to
have parent pointing to containing element.</p>
<p> There is however a tradeoff: weak linking elements means you can not
traverse tree bottom-up - calling getParent() on weak-linked element may return
parent from <b>another</b> tree!</p>
